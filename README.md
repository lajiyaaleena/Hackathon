The 2001 and 2011 census data of education and workers show that there has been some progress in improving the educational and occupational status of the people of Karnataka. However, there is still a lot of work to be done. The literacy rate has increased over the years, gender gap in literacy has also narrowed. The unemployment rate has also decreased in 2011 as compared to 2001.This shows that the economy is creating more jobs.
However, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. The dropout rate from school is still high, especially among girls. There is also a need to improve the quality of education, especially in rural areas.
